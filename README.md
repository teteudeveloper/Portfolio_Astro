## Technologies Used

### Astro
A modern framework focused on performance and minimal JavaScript delivery, enabling fast-loading and optimized static websites.

### React
Used for interactive components where client-side interactivity is required, without sacrificing overall performance.

### TypeScript
Provides static typing, improving code reliability, maintainability, and long-term scalability.

### Tailwind CSS
A utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid development of responsive and consistent UI layouts.

## Architecture Overview
The portfolio follows a **static-first architecture** with selective client-side hydration:

- Static content generated via Astro  
- Interactive components implemented with React  
- Styling handled through Tailwind CSS

This approach balances performance and interactivity while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.
